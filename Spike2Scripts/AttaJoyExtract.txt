This is the format of the attajoy extract script output file. 

The file is placed in the same dir as the data file. It has the same 
base name as the data file, with extension "ajj". 

The output file has 8 columns (separated by spaces):
ttype, ptype, tFixpt, tStim, ctype, tChange, tEndTrial, tResponse


ttype: Trial type. 0 (1) for F/Attend-towards (G/Attend-away)
ptype: Pulse type: 0 (1) for no pulse (yes pulse)
tFixpt: time of onset of fixation point
tStim: Time of onset of stimulus
ctype: change type 0 (1) for C/Attend-towards-changes (D/Attend-away-changes)
       If -1, trial was aborted prior to contrast change. In this case, tChange, tResponse
	   have no meaning. 
tChange: time of contrast change
tEndTrial: time trial ends, when all stim turned off
tResponse: time when joystick response occurred
