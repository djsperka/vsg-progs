The files in this folder are stimuli input files sent to us with the source code for the sparse noise applications for the VSG.
There were four different files:

d2048.snf
d4096.snf
d8192.snf
d27.snf

The documentation accompanying the source code said that d27 was the only stim being used. Its order is 13 and had 8192 terms. 
The order in the 2048 file is 4 (incorrect?) and the order in the 4096 file is 8 (incorrect). I saved the files with different 
names for completeness.
