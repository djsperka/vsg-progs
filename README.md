library and collection of visual stimulus programs written for the VSG and Visage from Cambridge Research Systems (http://crsltd.com)

This represents 15+ yrs of development of visual stimuli using the Visage system from CRS (and its prececessor the VSG 2/5). 
As such, there is quite a bit of old abandoned code which I will be clearing out and removing.
