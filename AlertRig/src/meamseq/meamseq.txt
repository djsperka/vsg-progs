-------

Usage:

meamseq -p x,y -m msequence-file-name -o order -d dotsize -r rows -c columns \
        -t frames-per-term [-v] [-K]

x,y : screen position, in pixels, of the center of the grid pattern. 
      The center of the screen is (0,0), and x is positive-going-right, 
      y is positive-going-up.
msequence-file-name : the path to a text file containing the m-sequence. 
                      The file should contain only '0' and '1', and no extraneous 
                      spaces or newlines. There should be EXACTLY (2**order - 1) 
                      characters in the file
order : the order of the msequence. There are 2**order - 1 terms in the sequence. 
        Our "standard" m-sequence has order 15.
dotsize : the size in pixels of each square in the grid pattern
rows : the number of rows in the grid pattern
columns : the number of columns in the grid pattern
frames-per-term : the number of video frames for each term in the sequence 


The "-K" option runs the program in a testing mode - normally not useful in the lab. 
The following options are available:

'a' : show aperture
'n' : no aperture
'm' : run the msequence in its entirety
<number> : place this term in the sequence in the aperture window on screen. Use this to display
           a particular term or terms in the sequence. 
'q' : quit
