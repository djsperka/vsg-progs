Usage:

meatuning [-K] [-v] -t stimtime -b bgcolor -g grating-spec -d screen-dist \
          -C|O|A|S|T|X tuning-parameter-list [-x xy-contrast-frequency]

meatuning [-K] [-v] -b bgcolor -d screen-dist -u seconds-between-curves -f curve-list-file

The first method above allows you to specify a single tuning curve. The second allows you to 
specify a series of tuning curves, where the file 'curve-list-file' contains the parameters
for each tuning curve. 


stimtime : stimulus time. Each stimulus is presented for this many seconds. 
    Intervening blank screen is presented for this many seconds also 
    (plus a short period for reloading stim). 
bgcolor : background color. Value may be one of 'black', 'gray', 'white', 
          'red', 'green', blue'.
grating-spec : grating specification. See below for format and details.
screen-dist : distance from subject to screen, in MM. This is used for 
              grating spatial frequency values
tuning-parameter-list : list of tuned parameters, comma separated, no spaces.
                        The flag values indicate which grating spec parameter
                        is varied:
                        C - contrast, [-100, 100]
                        O - orientation, [0, 360]
                        A - area [NOT IMPLEMENTED!]
                        S - spatial frequency (0, 100]. Can't specify 0!
                        T - temporal frequency [0, 100].
                        X - XY test. Parameters specify spatial phase [0,360]
xy-contrast-frequency : freq (Hz) for contrast frequency in XY tuning. One 
                        complete cycle starts at contrast=100, then runs down
                        to contrast=-100 and back up to contrast=100. This value
                        is REQUIRED for xy tuning, it is ignored for all 
                        other types (and may be omitted). 
seconds-between-curves : When a curve-list-file is used, this is the time between the stimuli 
                         for the different tuning curves. See below for more explanation. 
curve-list-file : text file containing specifications for any number of tuning curves. The format is described
                  below.  


The "-K" option runs the program in a testing mode - normally not useful in the lab.

The following options are available:

'0' : switch to page 0 - background color
'1' : switch to page 1 - this page has the stimuli
'c' : cycle through all stimuli (this is how an experiment will display stimuli)
's' : step to next stim. Useful if you first say '1', then you can step through 
      each stim. 
'q' : quit


Grating specification

The grating specification gives the parameters for a grating. The format of the spec is

x,y,w,h,contrast%,sf,tf,orientation,color_vector,s|q,r|e

x,y,w,h in degrees
contrast should be an integer from 0-100. 
sf - spatial frequency in cycles per degree
tf - temporal drift frequency in cycles/sec
0 <= orientation < 360
color_vector should be b|w|black|white|gray|... for black/white
s|q indicates pattern type, s for sine wave, q for square wave
r|e indicates aperture type, r for rectangular (height h, width w), e for elliptical

The last three args (color_vector, pattern, aperture) can be omitted. The 
default values are black/white color vector, sine wave, elliptical aperture. 

For the meatuning application, the aperture is NOT IMPLEMENTED! All gratings are drawn
FULL SCREEN. The x,y,w,h parameters should all be zero!


Tuning Parameters

The grating parameter for a tuned value is ignored and the values from the 
tuning-parameter-list are used instead. For example, if you specify a contrast
tuning stimulus (-C), the contrast value in the grating spec is ignored. You 
still must give a value in the spec (otherwise the grating spec will be parsed
incorrectly!). 


Examples (SINGLE TUNING CURVE)

meatuning -t 4.0 -b gray -g 0,0,0,0,100,.3,0.00,90.0,b,s,e -d 500 -X 0,90,180,270 -x 0.25

XY tuning. Grating sf is 0.3 cycles/degree, where degrees are measured for a subject
distance of 500mm. Temporal freq is 0. Orientation is 90 degrees. Grating is b/w. 
Gratings will be presented for 4 seconds, followed by a 4 second blank page (background
color is gray). There are 4 gratings presented in this way. The second, third and fourth
are presented with a spatial phase offset of 90, 180 and 270 degrees with respect to the 
first. The contrast for each stimuli starts at 100, then cycles with a frequency of 
0.25 Hz. 



Example (MULTIPLE TUNING CURVES)

meatuning -b gray -d 500 -u 4.0 -f mylist.txt

This will run a series of tuning curves specified in 'mylist.txt'. This file contains specifications
for tuning curves, one per line. No blank lines or comments are allowed. Here is a sample of such 
a file:

-------begin below this line -------------------
-t 1.0 -g 0,0,0,0,100,.3,3.00,90.0,b,s,e -O 0,60,120,180,240,300
-t 1.0 -g 0,0,0,0,100,.3,3.00,90.0,b,s,e -S 0.1,.5,1,4,8
-t 1.0 -g 0,0,0,0,100,.3,3.00,90.0,b,s,e -C 11,28,44,75,100
-------end above this line----------------------

This file specifies three tuning curves. In between the curves there is a 4.0 second blank page. 
The first is an orientation curve (0, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 degrees), with stimuli 
(and intervening blank page) displayed for 1.0s each. 
The second curve is Spatial frequency, again with stimuli and blanks displayed for 1.0s each. 
The third curve is contrast, again with stimuli and blanks displayed for 1.0s each.



Triggers

Triggers are output at the onset of each stimuli, and the onset of the blank page following each stimuli, 
and at the end of the blank period. Thus, for the orientation curve above, there will be 3 triggers for each
orientation listed. 

At the end of each curve there are two additional triggers, separated by one frame length, to denote the 
transition from one tuning curve to the next.
