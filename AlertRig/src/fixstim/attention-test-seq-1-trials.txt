# Specify a series of "trials". Fixstim will cycle through on the "a" trigger.
# Trial starts with word "Trial" at the beginning of a line. Anything
# that follows the word "Trial" is ignored. Trials are saved in the order that 
# they're found in this file.

# The second line of the trial is color,init phase,offbits 
# Those should be in the same format as before

# Next is 1-n lines, each specifying the graphic (fixpt, cues, or , a time
# point, and a contrast.
# [FQ012...],t(sec),contrast

# The available objects (and the characters to identify them with) are 
# the fixpt (F), cues (Q), and each of the stimuli given on the command line.
# The stimuli are identified with 0, 1, 2, ..., according to their order on
# on the command line.
#
# The last line MUST have a special index "*". The time point
# indicates the end of the trial, and a blank screen is displayed. 

# Each trial will begin with the fixpt on, and nothing else on. 
# The fixpt and cues are turned on and off by setting contrast 100/0.

# Here is the first trial from the test file

# The cues turn on at 1 sec, and turn off at 2 sec. Stim 0, 1, 2, 3  come on 
# with contrast=100 at 3 sec. Stim 0 changes to contrast=50 at 4 sec, and back
# to contrast=100 at 5 sec. Stim 1 makes a contrast change to contrast=50 at 
# 6 sec, and back to contrast=100 at 7 sec. The trial ends at 8s, and the screen 
# returns to the bkgd. 

# When cues are drawn, _what_ is drawn depends on the command line arg (Q, q or r)
# used for the cues argument. If cue points are to be drawn, they'll be overwritten
# by a grating unless the grating's contrast=0.

# The only real limitation is on the total number of grating/contrast pairs (not 
# counting contrast=0). This number can't be greater than (nstim*2).
