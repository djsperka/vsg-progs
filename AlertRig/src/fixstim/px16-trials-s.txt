# This file lays out the trials in a "Mel Stim" 
#
# blank lines and lines that begin with "#" are ignored
# Capitalization Does nOt matTER EXCEPT FOR BMP FILENAMES! 
#
# A line that begins with "Folder" specifies a folder that contains bmp images to be used. 
# The images should all reside in that folder, or in a subfolder, and all should have extension ".bmp"
# When specifying a bmp file to use, give the part of the full file path (including extension) AFTER
# the path on the "Folder" line. For example, if you have this file directory layout:
#
# c:\data\images
# c:\data\images\bkgd   (this folder has bmp files with background images)
# c:\data\images\stim   (this folder has bmp files with stim images)
#
# Now, if you use this line:
#
# Folder c:\data\images
#
# Then, when using a file named "c:\data\images\bkgd\file1.bmp", the bmp lines should look like this:
#
# bmp bkgd\file1.bmp,100,200,P,128
#
#
# A trial starts with a "trial" line and is followed by "time" blocks, 
# each of which has one or more bmp files specified. 
#
# The "time" block looks like this (*):
# time t
# bmp folder\filename.bmp,x,y[,X,n]
#
# Alternatively, use "frames" (from the start of the stim period) instead of time (in seconds from the start of the stim period)
# frames n
# bmp folder\filename.bmp
#
# (*) A trial is ended with a special time block:
# time t end
#
# EACH TRIAL MUST END WITH ONE OF THESE SPECIAL TIME BLOCKS!
# The end block has to be the last one in the file - put it after all rect lines for the trial (don't rely on sorting for the end)
#
# A "bmp" line specifies a bmp file to be drawn on the screen. 
# The x,y is where the CENTER of the bmp is placed, in pixels - WITH POSITIVE Y "UP".
# The additional characters [,X,n] may be omitted. If included, the allowed values of "X" are
# P - copy color palette from this image to HW palette. The number is the number of levels to be copied.
# S - TRANSONSOURCE - the number is a level number. If a pixel in the bmp file has that level number it is NOT drawn
# D - TRANSONDEST - same as above, but if a pixel in the destination (whatever has already been drawn there) has that 
#     level number the corresponding source pixel is NOT drawn. 
#
#
#
#
# For the scheme we are using, where the STIMULUS bmp can contain pixels drawn at level 255, then the following sequence
# draws a background image (and uses 128 levels of its palette), then overlays a stimulus image, ignoring any pixels in 
# the stimulus bmp that are level 255
# The files used will be 
# c:\Users\Lab\Desktop\djs\cbmp\px16_on_cardinal_1.bmp and 
# c:\Users\Lab\Desktop\djs\cbmp\s_px16_on_ang0_1.bmp
#
# Folder c:\Users\Lab\Desktop\djs\cbmp
# Time 0.5
# Bmp px16_on_cardinal_1.bmp,0,0,P,128
# Bmp s_px16_on_ang0_1.bmp,0,0,S,255
#
#
# IMPORTANT
#
# - Each trial will use the last "P" palette copy. In trial 1 below, notice that only the first bmp (at Time 0.5)
#   has a "P,128" - to copy 128 levels from the bmp file to the hw palette. That palette will be used by everything that
#   follows.
# - Each of the stimulus bmp files uses "S,255" to indicate "TRANSONSOURCE" with level 255 -- meaning that pixels in
#   the bmp file are NOT written to the vsg if they are at level 255. 
# - The levels from 0-127 are available for use by the stimulus files. No need to copy the palette again. 
# - The program assumes that NO MORE THAN 128 levels are to be copied.
