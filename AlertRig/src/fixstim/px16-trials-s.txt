# This file lays out the trials in a "Mel Stim" 
#
# blank lines and lines that begin with "#" are ignored
# Capitalization Does nOt matTER
#
# A trial starts with a "trial" line and is followed by "time" blocks and an optional "grid" line.
# A "grid" line and "time" blocks can come in any order
# "time" blocks can be broken into multiple pieces
#
# The "grid" line looks like this:
# grid x,y,w,h,ori
#
# where
#    x,y are the center of the grid; the position 0,0 in grid coordinates corresponds to this position in eye coords
#    w,h are the width,height of each grid rectangle, in the same units that x,y are in 
#    ori is the orientation of the grid. This is the angle that the x-axis of the grid makes with the screen's positive x-axis.
#    Positive orientation angles run counter-clockwise from the screen's +x axis. 
#
#
# The "time" block looks like this (*):
# time t
# rect u,v,a,b,rect-ori,color
# <multiple rects allowed>
#
# (*) A trial is ended with a special time block:
# time t end
#
# EACH TRIAL MUST END WITH ONE OF THESE SPECIAL TIME BLOCKS!
# The end block has to be the last one in the file - put it after all rect lines for the trial (don't rely on sorting for the end)
#
# The "rect" line specifies a rect be drawn
# rect u,v,a,b,rect-ori,color
#
# where
#    u,v is the rect center in grid coordinates
#    a,b are the width,height of the rect, in units of w,h - the grid rect size from the "grid" line (default = 1,1)
#    rect-ori is the rect orientation in the grid system. (default 0) When the rect is drawn, this value is added to the orientation of the grid.
#    color is the rect color. (default white)
#
# A rect that is aligned with the grid, and scale=1 can just use u,v:
# rect 3,1
#
#


# This trial has axis-aligned grid, with grid rects size 1,1
# There is a vertical "stack" of 7 rects that move from left to right
# Note the small gaps that appear between some of the rects at different steps
