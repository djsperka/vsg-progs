# A "trial" is a set of stimuli that obey the standard
# F/S/X/a sequence of triggers. The "S" will be an animated series of gratings
# and cues, with contrast changes, cues turning on/off, etc. 
#
# In this file, you specify a set of trials. A trial (in this file) is specified 
# with an initial line that starts with "trial" (case ignored). 
# Next, there is a line with fixpt color, offbits, initial phases for gratings.
# The format is
#
# color,offbits,initial_phase_grating_0,initial_phase_grating_1,initial_phase_grating_2,initial_phase_grating_3
# 
# Example from below:
# (255/0/255),0,180,0,0,180
# Fixpt is yellow, offbits is 0 (all cues and gratings used), the first+fourth 
# gratings have init phase 180, and the second+third have init phase 0.
#
# Next is 1-n lines, each specifying the graphic (fixpt, cues, or , a time
# point, and a contrast. The graphic is indicated with a letter (F for fixpt, 
# Q for cues), a number (0, 1, 2 ... for gratings, according to their order on 
# command line), or a "*", which indicates the end of the trial. These lines 
# look like this
# 
# [FQ012...],t(sec),contrast
#
# The available objects (and the characters to identify them with) are 
# the fixpt (F), cues (Q), and each of the stimuli given on the command line.
# The stimuli are identified with 0, 1, 2, ..., according to their order on
# on the command line.
# Each trial will begin with the fixpt on, and nothing else on, as if
# there is are lines that read
# F,0.0,100
# Q,0.0,0
#
# The fixpt and cues are turned on and off by setting contrast 100/0.
# This line turns cues on at t=2.3
#
# Q,2.3,100
# 
# The last line MUST have a special index "*". The time point
# indicates the end of the trial, and a blank screen is displayed. 
#
#
# Here is the first trial from the test file

# Trigger "F" will turn on fixpt. 
# Trigger "S" will initiate an animation that progresses like this:
# At t=0, the fixpt is on, nothing else. 
# The cues turn on at 1 sec, and turn off at 2 sec. Stim 0, 1, 2, 3  come on 
# with contrast=100 at 3 sec. Stim 0 changes to contrast=50 at 4 sec, and back
# to contrast=100 at 5 sec. Stim 1 makes a contrast change to contrast=50 at 
# 6 sec, and back to contrast=100 at 7 sec. The trial ends at 8s, and the screen 
# returns to the bkgd. 

# When cues are drawn, _what_ is drawn depends on the command line arg (Q, q or r)
# used for the cues argument. If cue points are to be drawn, they'll be overwritten
# by a grating unless the grating's contrast=0.

# The only real limitation is on the total number of grating/contrast pairs (not 
# counting contrast=0). This number can't be greater than (nstim*2).
