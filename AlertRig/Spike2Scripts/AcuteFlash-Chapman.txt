AcuteFlash-Chapman
------------------

This spike2 script will generate a full-field solid-color stimulus with a repeating pattern. 

The colors black, gray and white can be used. A repeating pattern of up to 4 of these colors
can be specified, with each color appearing on the screen for a length of time that you
can specify.

The entire sequence of full-field flash colors will be repeated as many times as you require. 


The dialog has the following fields:

Number of Channels: 1-8, the number of DAQ channels you are using. Assumes that you use analog
                    ports 0, 1, 2, ..., in that order. If you are using just one channel, 
                    specify 1 here and make sure your electrode output goes to the analog input
                    port 0 on the 1401. If you use two channels, specify 2 here and make sure
                    your electrode outputs are in analog input ports 0 and 1 on the 1401. 

Number of repeats : How many times you want the pattern to repeat. 

Color n
Time(s) n         : There are 4 sets of entries, numbered 1-4. The color dropdown can be NONE, 
                    Black, Gray or White. The script will generate a pattern using each of the 
                    color dropdowns until it encounters one that is NONE. You must specify the 
                    colors starting from 1. Any color dropdowns after the first NONE found will 
                    be ignored. The Time(s) field is the time in seconds that this color will 
                    be on screen. 

                    Example: You want Black(1s)/Gray(1s)/White(1s)/Gray(1s)

                    Color 1 - Black
                    Time 1 - 1
                    Color 2 - Gray
                    Time 2 - 1
                    Color 3 - White
                    Time 3 - 1
                    Color 4 - Gray
                    Time 4 - 1


                    Example: Gray(0.5s)/White(1s)/Black(1s)

                    Color 1 - Gray
                    Time 1 - 0.5
                    Color 2 - White
                    Time 2 - 1
                    Color 3 - Black
                    Time 3 - 1
                    Color 4 - NONE
                    Time 4 - doesn't matter - ignored
